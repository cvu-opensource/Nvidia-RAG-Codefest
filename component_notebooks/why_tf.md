## Why do these notebooks exist


Lets run shit as a microservice collection. As 3SG Gerard (STC) said, 4 seperate containers that can be upped simultaneously as services; 1 for DB, 1 for UI, 1 for data ingestion (updating vector store), and 1 for inference. Because we will only get access to the clusters at a later date, just seperate the code relevant to each service for now within a python notebook.
