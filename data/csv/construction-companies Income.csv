Scenarios,Tax Treatment,context
"Early Stages of a ContractProfit is not recognised until a certain minimum percentage of completion (commonly 20%) for the project is attained.Consequently, the tax payable in the early stages of a construction contract is deferred to a later Year of Assessment.","Generally, IRAS expects your construction company to recognise contract revenue over time for tax reporting purposes. IRAS will accept income recognition based on a minimum percentage threshold only if there is evidence to show the reasonableness  of the threshold adopted. Examples of supporting evidence are:Internal reviews carried out to arrive at the thresholdIndependent party evidence, such as those from professional engineer/ surveyor, on project uncertainties that make it impractical to assess the percentage of completion",construction-companies Income
Income Recognition over TimeDifferent methods are used to compute the POC to recognise contract revenue and contract costs respectively for the same project.,"This is acceptable for tax purposes only if under the relevant accounting standard, contract revenue and contract costs are allowed to be recognised on different bases.",construction-companies Income
"Income Recognition at a Point in TimeProfit is recognised only when the project is 100% completed â€“ this is commonly known in the industry as the Completed Contract Method ('CCM') of income recognition.Consequently, the tax payable on the construction contract is deferred to the Year of Assessment in which the project is completed.",Income recognition under CCM is not acceptable as contract revenue is to be recognised over time for tax reporting purposes.,construction-companies Income
Retention Sum ReceivableRetention sum receivable is not recognised as contract revenue.,"Retention sum is part of the contract revenue which is to be brought to tax based on POC. Where there is a payment default by the customer, the defaulted amount may be allowable as bad debts.",construction-companies Income
