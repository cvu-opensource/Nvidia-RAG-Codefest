Eligibility Period,Scenario and Type of Property Tax Relief,context
1 Jan 2020 to 31 Dec 2020,"As part of the Resilience Budget announced on 26 Mar 2020, qualifying non-residential properties (“qualifying properties”) are granted property tax rebate for the period of 1 Jan 2020 to 31 Dec 2020. This is an enhancement  of the property tax rebate announced at Budget 2020, on 18 Feb 2020. The property tax rebate is enhanced by extending the rebate to additional types of properties, and increasing the amount of rebate for certain types of properties.Under the Resilience Budget, owners of qualifying properties are granted rebates of up to 100% on their property tax payable. For most properties that are eligible for 100% property tax rebate, this is equivalent to about 1.2 months of  rental.Owners of qualifying properties are required to unconditionally and fully pass on to their tenant(s) the rebate for the property tax account that is attributable to the rented property, by either reducing or offsetting current or future  rentals or through a payment to their tenant(s), within the prescribed timeframe.Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Act passed on 5 Jun 2020, to provide relief for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) operating in qualifying non-residential properties, owners of such  qualifying properties will be granted Government cash grant. These property owners are required to provide rental relief through a waiver of rent for their eligible SME and NPO tenant-occupiers. Please refer to the Ministry of Law’s  website on Rental Relief Framework for more information.Generally, where the Rental Relief Framework applies, the rental waivers may be offset (partially, or otherwise) against any monetary payments or rental reductions provided, or earlier agreed to, by the landlord and the tenants on or after  1 February 2020, as well as any property tax rebate that owners have passed on or are obliged to pass on to their tenants on or before 31 July 2020 in respect of the property. Please refer to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020 for details.  Conversely, where a property owner has satisfied its obligation to provide rental waivers under the Rental Relief Framework, the net amount of rental waiver that has been provided by the property owner under the Rental Relief Framework  will also go towards satisfying the property owner’s obligation to pass on the property tax rebate. Please refer to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Transfer of Benefit of Property Tax Remission) Regulations 2020.The rebate is 100% of the property tax payable for:Hotel room or function room of a hotel registered under the Hotels Act (“registered hotel”);Serviced apartment or serviced apartment function room;Premises of prescribed Meetings, Incentive Travel, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) venues, namely Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre, Singapore EXPO, and Changi Exhibition Centre;Premises of an international airport i.e. Singapore Changi Airport;Premises of a prescribed international cruise or regional ferry terminal. The prescribed cruise and ferry terminals are Singapore Cruise Centre, Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal;Shops (e.g. retail) and restaurants, including those within hotels, serviced apartments, the prescribed MICE venues under Item 3 as well as those in office, industrial, residential and mixed-use developments; andPremises of tourist attractions (e.g. Singapore Zoological Gardens, Singapore Flyer and Haw Par Villa). The rebate is 60% of the property tax payable for:Marina Bay Sands; andResorts World Sentosa.The above 100% property tax rebate does not apply to them.The rebate is 30% for any premises excluding the following:Premises mentioned above that qualify for the 100% or 60% rebate;Premises used whether wholly or partly for an excluded purpose;The part of a carpark in the same building or development as premises mentioned in item 2 that corresponds to those premises; andAny other premises in the same building or development as premises mentioned in item 2, that are used or intended to be used for or in connection with the operation or enjoyment of those premises. Examples are space for base station  and vending machine in a residential condominium.Premises are used for an excluded purpose if they are used or intended to be used:For any residential purposes; orAs a facility for the exclusive use of residents of residential premises such as gym, function and meeting space and club lounge, whether with or without their guests.For avoidance of doubt, no rebate shall be given to vacant land or land under redevelopment.Property owners are not required to submit any claims for the rebate. The rebate notices have been issued and posted to property owners in end-April 2020. Property owners can log in to myTax Portal to view their notices.For properties that qualify for 100% rebate, the property tax payable for 2020 are fully refunded. For property owners who have an ongoing GIRO instalment plan, there is no GIRO deduction from Apr to Dec 2020. However, if you have tax  arrears, the GIRO deduction would have resumed in Jun 2020.If owners of properties which are granted 60% or 30% rebate have an ongoing instalment plan, with the rebate offsetting the instalment payment, there will be no GIRO deduction for a period ranging from four to seven months starting from  May 2020.For information on whether your property qualifies for the rebate, property owner’s obligations to pass the property tax rebate on to tenants and other administrative details, please refer to the e-Tax Guide for Property Tax Rebate for Non-Residential Properties in 2020 (Fifth Edition) (PDF, 945KB).
