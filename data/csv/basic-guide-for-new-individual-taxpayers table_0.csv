You may choose to log in to myTax Portal to preview  your tax bill, also known as the Notice of Assessment, and request for an early assessment by 18 Apr. Otherwise, your tax bill (digital or paper format) will be sent to you from end Apr onwards.  Your tax bill is computed  based on your auto-included income and previous yearâ€™s relief claims, if any, which may be adjusted if you do not meet the eligibility criteria. It is your responsibility to ensure that your tax bill is accurate.  If  you have any other income that is not shown in the tax bill, or your relief claims in the tax bill are incorrect, please inform us via the ""Amend Tax Bill"" digital service at myTax Portal within 30 days from the date  of your tax bill. Alternatively, please email us the details of your amendments if you are unable to use the  digital service.",basic-guide-for-new-individual-taxpayers table_0
