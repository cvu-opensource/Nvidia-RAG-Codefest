1 Jan 2024 to 31 Dec 2024,"To cushion the impact of the PT increases, amidst concerns about cost-of-living, the Government will provide a one-off PT rebate of up to 100% for all owner-occupied residential properties as shown below. The rebate is tiered to ensure that our PT regime remains progressive, and those with greater means pay their fair share of taxes. The Property Tax Rebate will automatically be given to eligible properties and will be reflected in the 2024 Property Tax Bill issued in Dec 2023.Table 1: 2024 Property Tax Rebates for Owner-Occupied Residential Properties1 & 2-room flat 3-room flat4-room flat5-room flatExecutive HDBPrivate property100%70%50%40%30%15%; capped at $1,000 Please refer to the following examples for an illustration of the computation of the Property Tax Rebate.Example A – 3-room HDB Flat2024 Property Tax Payable : $100Less: 2024 Property Tax Rebate (70% of 2024 Property Tax) : $70Total Property Tax Payable : $30 Example B – Private Property2024 Property Tax Payable : $7,500Less: 2024 Property Tax Rebate (15% of 2024 Property Tax, capped at $1,000) : $1,000Total Property Tax Payable : $6,500 Note:The Property Tax Rebate will be computed based on the property tax payable for the period when the property is owner-occupied.
