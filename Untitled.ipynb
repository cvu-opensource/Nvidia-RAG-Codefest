The browser is Firefox, and the page is displaying a Python script that is running in a Jupyter notebook environment. The script is using the `batch_decode` function from the `transformers` library to process some data. The notebook is titled \"Untitled.ipynb\" and is in the \"Kernel\" tab, which is set to a 2GPU kernel.\\n\\nThe script is as follows:\\n\\n```python\\noutput_text = processor.batch_decode(\\n    generated_ids_trimmed, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False\\n)\\nprint(output_text)\\n```\\n\\nThe notebook is running on a machine with the IP address 103.179.204.75:9000/user/g05/lab/tree/sgp_bootcamp_material/project/Untitled.ipynb. The current time is 13:53 on November 20th.\\n\\nThe output of the script is being displayed in the notebook, and there is a warning message from the `huggingface/tokenizers` library indicating that the current process just got forked after parallelism has already been used. The warning suggests disabling parallelism to avoid deadlocks and provides two options to do so:\\n\\n1. Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible.\\n2. Explicitly set the environment variable `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)`.\\n\\nAdditionally, there is a warning from the `transformers` library indicating that the `generate()` function is being called with `input_ids` on a device type different from the model\\'s device. The warning suggests that the `input_ids` should be on the correct device before running `generate()`.\\n\\nThe notebook also contains a table that outlines the conditions and corresponding CIT Rebate Cash Grant amounts for companies based on whether they meet local employee conditions and receive a CIT Rebate Cash Grant of $2,000. The table is divided into two scenarios:\\n\\n1. If the CIT Rebate is less than or equal to $2,000, no CIT Rebate is given.\\n2. If the CIT Rebate is greater than $2,000, the CIT Rebate (capped at $40,000).\\n\\nThe notebook is in the \"Command\" mode, and the current line is at the beginning of the notebook.']\n"
